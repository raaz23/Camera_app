This app allows users to capture and record videos with real-time filters, providing a fun and creative way to enhance their video content. The app features:

✨ A variety of dynamic filters to choose from, transforming videos with stunning effects.
✨ Zoom in and out functionalities for capturing the perfect shot.
✨ Real-time recording and playback capabilities for seamless user experience.
✨ Option to save your edited videos and images to your device or share them directly.

I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating media capture, real-time video processing, and interactive user interfaces.
